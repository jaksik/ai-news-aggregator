However, purely data-driven approaches often struggle in realistic settings characterized by sparse data, high-dimensional design spaces, and nontrivial physical constraints. This perspective argues for a new generation of design systems that transcend black-box modeling by integrating domain knowledge, physics-informed learning, and intuitive human-AI interfaces. We first demonstrate how expert-guided sampling strategies enhance data efficiency and model generalization. Next, we discuss how physics-informed machine learning enables physically consistent modeling in data-scarce regimes. Finally, we explore how large language models emerge as interactive design agents connecting user intent with simulation tools, optimization pipelines, and collaborative workflows. Through illustrative examples and conceptual frameworks, we advocate that inverse design in manufacturing should evolve into a unified ecosystem, where domain knowledge, physical priors, and adaptive reasoning collectively enable scalable, interpretable, and accessible AI-driven design systems.","newsCategory":"Interesting but Lower Priority","techCategory":"Research and Innovation"},{"index":17,"title":"The Automated but Risky Game: Modeling Agent-to-Agent Negotiations and Transactions in Consumer Markets","description":"arXiv:2506.00073v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AI agents are increasingly used in consumer-facing applications to assist with tasks such as product search, negotiation, and transaction execution. In this paper, we explore a future scenario where both consumers and merchants authorize AI agents to fully automate negotiations and transactions. We aim to answer two key questions: (1) Do different LLM agents vary in their ability to secure favorable deals for users? (2) What risks arise from fully automating deal-making with AI agents in consumer markets? To address these questions, we develop an experimental framework that evaluates the performance of various LLM agents in real-world negotiation and transaction settings. Our findings reveal that AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently imbalanced game -- different agents achieve significantly different outcomes for their users. Moreover, behavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses for both consumers and merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. These results underscore that while automation can improve efficiency, it also introduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating business decisions to AI agents.","newsCategory":"Interesting but Lower Priority","techCategory":"Research and Innovation"},{"index":18,"title":"Strategic Reflectivism In Intelligent Systems","description":"arXiv:2505.22987v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: By late 20th century, the rationality wars had launched debates about the nature and norms of intuitive and reflective thinking. Those debates drew from mid-20th century ideas such as bounded rationality, which challenged more idealized notions of rationality observed since the 19th century. Now that 21st century cognitive scientists are applying the resulting dual process theories to artificial intelligence, it is time to dust off some lessons from this history. So this paper synthesizes old ideas with recent results from experiments on humans and machines. The result is Strategic Reflectivism, which takes the position that one key to intelligent systems (human or artificial) is pragmatic switching between intuitive and reflective inference to optimally fulfill competing goals. Strategic Reflectivism builds on American Pragmatism, transcends superficial indicators of reflective thinking such as model size or chains of thought, and becomes increasingly actionable as we learn more about the value of intuition and reflection.","newsCategory":"Likely Noise or Opinion","techCategory":"Not Relevant"},{"index":19,"title":"Tournament of Prompts: Evolving LLM Instructions Through Structured Debates and Elo Ratings","description":"arXiv:2506.00178v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Prompt engineering represents a critical bottleneck to harness the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving complex tasks, as it requires specialized expertise, significant trial-and-error, and manual intervention. This challenge is particularly pronounced for tasks involving subjective quality assessment, where defining explicit optimization objectives becomes fundamentally problematic. Existing automated prompt optimization methods falter in these scenarios, as they typically require well-defined task-specific numerical fitness functions or rely on generic templates that cannot capture the nuanced requirements of complex use cases. We introduce DEEVO (DEbate-driven EVOlutionary prompt optimization), a novel framework that guides prompt evolution through a debate-driven evaluation with an Elo-based selection. Contrary to prior work, DEEVOs approach enables exploration of the discrete prompt space while preserving semantic coherence through intelligent crossover and strategic mutation operations that incorporate debate-based feedback, combining elements from both successful and unsuccessful prompts based on identified strengths rather than arbitrary splicing. Using Elo ratings as a fitness proxy, DEEVO simultaneously drives improvement and preserves valuable diversity in the prompt population. Experimental results demonstrate that DEEVO significantly outperforms both manual prompt engineering and alternative state-of-the-art optimization approaches on open-ended tasks and close-ended tasks despite using no ground truth feedback. By connecting LLMs reasoning capabilities with adaptive optimization, DEEVO represents a significant advancement in prompt optimization research by eliminating the need of predetermined metrics to continuously improve AI systems.","newsCategory":"Interesting but Lower Priority","techCategory":"Research and Innovation"},{"index":20,"title":"Balancing Profit and Fairness in Risk-Based Pricing Markets","description":"arXiv:2506.00140v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Dynamic, risk-based pricing can systematically exclude vulnerable consumer groups from essential resources such as health insurance and consumer credit. We show that a regulator can realign private incentives with social objectives through a learned, interpretable tax schedule. First, we provide a formal proposition that bounding each firm's \\emph{local} demographic gap implicitly bounds the \\emph{global} opt-out disparity, motivating firm-level penalties. Building on this insight we introduce \\texttt{MarketSim} -- an open-source, scalable simulator of heterogeneous consumers and profit-maximizing firms -- and train a reinforcement learning (RL) social planner (SP) that selects a bracketed fairness-tax while remaining close to a simple linear prior via an $\\mathcal{L}_1$ regularizer. The learned policy is thus both transparent and easily interpretable. In two empirically calibrated markets, i.e., U.S. health-insurance and consumer-credit, our planner simultaneously raises demand-fairness by up to $16\\%$ relative to unregulated Free Market while outperforming a fixed linear schedule in terms of social welfare without explicit coordination. These results illustrate how AI-assisted regulation can convert a competitive social dilemma into a win-win equilibrium, providing a principled and practical framework for fairness-aware market oversight.","newsCategory":"Likely Noise or Opinion","techCategory":"Not Relevant"},{"index":21,"title":"Utilizing AI for Aviation Post-Accident Analysis Classification","description":"arXiv:2506.00169v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The volume of textual data available in aviation safety reports presents a challenge for timely and accurate analysis. This paper examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, specifically, Natural Language Processing (NLP) can automate the process of extracting valuable insights from this data, ultimately enhancing aviation safety. The paper reviews ongoing efforts focused on the application of NLP and deep learning to aviation safety reports, with the goal of classifying the level of damage to an aircraft and identifying the phase of flight during which safety occurrences happen. Additionally, the paper explores the use of Topic Modeling (TM) to uncover latent thematic structures within aviation incident reports, aiming to identify recurring patterns and potential areas for safety improvement. The paper compares and contrasts the performance of various deep learning models and TM techniques applied to datasets from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), as well as the Aviation Safety Network (ASN), discussing the impact of dataset size and source on the accuracy of the analysis. The findings demonstrate that both NLP and deep learning, as well as TM, can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of aviation safety analysis, paving the way for more proactive safety management and risk mitigation strategies.","newsCategory":"Interesting but Lower Priority","techCategory":"Research and Innovation"},{"index":22,"title":"OpenAI’s Sora is now available for FREE to all users through Microsoft Bing Video Creator on mobile","description":"OpenAI‘s Sora was one of the most hyped releases of the AI era, launching in December 2024, nearly 10 months after it was first previewed to awe-struck reactions due to its — at the time, at least — unprecedented level of realism, camera dynamism, and prompt adherence and 60-second long generation clips.
